Please see the great and original for now. I plan on adding search and maybe some other features, and then developing a WebUI to use it. Hopefully eventually an Android app for read offline use and maybe even iOS one day. I hope I can do it, I think it'll be cool!

I would also like to add more sources. MangaDex is one I would really like to do as it has multiple translation groups versions available - but I'd like to add lots more, in lots of languages. I'd also like to add VIZ, Crunchyroll and other legal sources too. CBR support as well as raw image fles as well as CBZ will also be an option. ANd I want to grab metadata for series.

I hope the original author is cool with it. They are free to use any of my changes for their project.
