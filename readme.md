Please see the great and original for now. I plan on adding search and maybe some other features, and then developing a WebUI to use it. Hopefully eventually an Android app for read offline use and maybe even iOS one day. I hope I can do it, I think it'll be cool!

I hope the original author is cool with it. They are free to use any of my changes for their project.
